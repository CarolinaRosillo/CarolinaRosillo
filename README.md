# 👋 Hi, I am Carolina Rosillo!

### About me
Enthusiastic professional with a strong desire to learn and grow in the area of software testing 🚀


- 🔭 I recently completed an online Bootcamp at TripleTen as a QA Engineer💪🏽

  This experience allowed me to gain knowledge in both manual and automated testing. I developed skills in tools such as Selenium WebDriver, Pytest, PyCharm, Postman,          JIRA, Figma, among others. Additionally, I applied this knowledge to real projects, working on food and transportation service applications.
  
- 🤓 I am currently continuing my education🧠

  I am focusing on consolidating my knowledge in APIs, SQL, and the Python programming language.
  
  
- 👨‍💻 Because I know that practice makes perfect👩🏽‍🏫 

  I conduct practice sessions on UPEX, a user testing platform where testers conduct evaluations of mobile applications and websites from the perspective of the end user.      And TEST IO, a crowdsourcing platform that connects companies in need of quality testing with a global community of qualified testers. On both platforms, I collaborate       with other testers to conduct manual and automated tests on a wide range of devices and environments to identify errors, usability issues, and potential improvements in      clients' applications and websites.

### Featured projects ✨
- [Urban Routes](https://github.com/carolinarosillo/urban-routes): A web application for transportation service where I implemented manual and automated testing. This project made me fall in love with test automation 😍. When the browser began to execute the code simulating the actions of a real user, I imagined all that automation is capable of. I am currently very motivated to learn more about this exciting world of technology.
